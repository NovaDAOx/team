A Jack of all engineering trades, I spent the last 12 years writing code for engineering applications, desktop and web apps. I founded a machine learning startup '17 that went through Techstars in '18. Training wise, I graduated from the great and snowy University of New Hampshire in '14 with B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and minor in Ocean Engineering. I'm deeply passionate about bleeding edge tech, buidling the impossible, and creating a more inclusive, borderless world through web3.
